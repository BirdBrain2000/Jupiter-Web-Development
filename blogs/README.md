This blogs page allows users to post blogs(articles) on subjects they are interested in.
I have added features that allow for editing, deleting, and creating these blog posts. This is all done with
html and python by using both the views.py from django as well as blogs.html to display the views and formatting.
The posts are also user protected and this means that other uses won't be able to delete or edit posts that don't
belong to them. This way we have some protection again people who want to delete everything. That is the functionality
of this app.
