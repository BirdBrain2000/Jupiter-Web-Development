# Jupiter-Web-Development

This is a project that demonstrates the work I have done throughout the semester of my Web Development class. I have tried to include as much as I can into the website.
Described below is a detailed description of the webpage overview.

I have implemented users onto the site so the first thing you will notice is the login or sign up button. This is because the access is restricted to users who aren't logged in 
because I don't want those users to have access to everything. The home page just has some text with some formatting, then am image shown below as well as links
to other pages on the site. When you are logged in you have access to these pages but when you aren't then the access is restricted. One of the other pages in the blog page.

The blog page allows users to post blogs about anything they would like and it will be shown for all users. The other link after the blog link is called a Juptier to-do list.
It is just a to-do list that allows you to add things, cross things off, as well as delete things. I thought this would be cool because that could be a helpful thing.
