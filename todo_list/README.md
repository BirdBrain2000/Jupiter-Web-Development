This app is a to-do list that allows all users who are logged in to add and remove things from the list.
This page won't show up unless you are loggin in which is nice. That way not anybody can see it. But once you are
logging you will be able to visit the page. Once on the page the is a table showing the list and buttons where you can
cross things off the list, and uncross things if you change your mind. Also we allow for deleting from the list so that
when things are finished the don't have to stick around. That is the basics of this app and we used bootstrap for
the table and the fancy header that looks nice.
